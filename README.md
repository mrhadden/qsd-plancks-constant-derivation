# Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD) — Planck’s Constant Derivation

This repository contains the theoretical framework, derivation, diagrams, and simulation demonstrating how Planck’s constant \( \hbar \) emerges as a structural property of a conserved quantum substrate.

## 🔬 Overview

Traditional quantum mechanics treats \( \hbar \) as a fundamental constant. In contrast, Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD) models mass, inertia, and gravity as coherence-locked behaviors of a stationary relativistic substrate — allowing a physically interpretable derivation of \( \hbar \).

The core result:

\[
\hbar = \frac{c_t^4}{c_s} \cdot \frac{L_{\text{coh}}^2}{G}
\]

Where:
- \( c_s \): Scalar collapse speed (substrate recovery rate)
- \( c_t \): Transverse coherence propagation speed
- \( L_{\text{coh}} \): Minimum spatial support for a full coherence offload
- \( G \): Substrate compliance (reinterpreted Newton’s constant)

## 🧪 Simulation

Includes a simple discrete model that demonstrates quantized emission from scalar recovery pacing. No imposed quantum behavior — discreteness emerges naturally from structural delay constraints.
